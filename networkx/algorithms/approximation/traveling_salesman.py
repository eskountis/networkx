    """Find the shortest path in G connecting specified nodes

    This function uses the Christofides algorithm to provide an
    approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.

    This function proceeds in two steps. First, it creates a complete
    graph using the all-pairs shortest_paths between nodes in `nodes`.
    Edges weights in the new graph are the lengths of the paths
    between each pair of nodes in the original graph.
    Second, the Christofides algorithm is used to approximate
    the minimal hamiltonian cycle on this new graph.
    The hamiltonian cycle is returned by `christofides`.

    This function then turns that hamiltonian cycle through `nodes`
    into a cycle on the original graph using shortest paths between
    nodes. It then returns the minimal cycle through `nodes` in `G`.
    If `cycle is False`, the biggest weight is removed to make a path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
      Undirected possibly weighted graph

    nodes : sequence of nodes
      sequence (list, set, etc) of nodes to visit

    weight : string optional (default=None)
      The name of the edge attribute to use for edge weights.
      Edge weights default to 1 if the weight attribute is not present.
      If None, every edge has weight 1.

    cycle : bool (default: True)
      Indicates whether a cycle should be returned, or a path
      Note: the systel is the approximate minimal cycle.
      The path simply removes the biggest edge in that cycle.

    Returns
    -------
    list of nodes in `G` along a path with a
    3/2-approximation of the minimal path through `nodes`.
